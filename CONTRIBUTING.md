# How to contribute

If you want to contribute, do one of these two things:

- Check issues to find something you can help with

- Make a custom fork and start a pull request with a detailed explanation of what you've changed, etc.

Global issues I personally have might also be noted in the README.md file.

  **Thanks for everyone who wants to help out**
