# YT-Focus
A better way to watch youtube. No ads, no tracking and no distractions. Pure focus and education (or entertainment).

A fork of ['Magic Tape'](https://gitlab.com/christosangel/magic-tape/-/tree/main?ref_type=heads) by Christos Angelopoulos

The original version has more features, but I want a more minimalistic and 'focused' approach.

With YT Focus, through the __main menu__, the user can

  * Browse  videos from __subscriptions__. (Not Working Currently)

  * make a video __search__, using keywords or phrases.

  * Watch a previously watched video (__watch history__).

  * Browse videos from a __subcsribed channel__.

  * __Watch/download__ video/audio content, in various formats.



Through the __miscellaneous menu__ the user can

  * __Set up Preferences__ (configuration).

  * __Import subscriptions__ from YouTube.

  * __Subscribe__ to/ __Unsubscribe__ from a channel.

or any other terminal emulator:

**<u>UPDATES</u>**:

1. The directory structure of the program has been updated. Instead of keeping everything in `~git/magic-tape/`, now various files and directories are kept in various places.This way,
  * the `magic-tape.sh` is in `~/.local/bin/`
  * the magic-tape cache files are all in `~/.cache/magic-tape/`
  * the configuration text file will be created in `~/.config/magic-tape/`
2. The action selection can be either with `rofi`, or `fzf` (if the user wants to go full TUI).This can be configured during the **P option** of the **misc menu**.
3. `dmenu` is also added as an action selector. This can be configured during the **P option** of the **misc menu**.
4. There is now a **duration filter prompt** in the **search** option which allows you to:

- Not add any filter

- Exclude shorts (semi working)

- Only show videos with a duration of 0-4 mins

- Only show videos with a duration of 4-20 mins

- Only show videos with a duration of 20 mins +
